# Curves

Just a few plain curve separators, nothing fancy, but good looking.

The interesting part are the tools here:
- [ShapeDivider](https://www.shapedivider.app/) : To create cool looking wave (and some other shapes) separators
- [Haikei](https://app.haikei.app): To create even cooler / complex looking wave (and other shapes) separators
- [Kute](https://thednp.github.io/kute.js/) : To animate SVG, not so popular on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kute.js), but still worth checking out.
