# Tailwind Discord Dup Version

Will create a small version of discord to explore tailwind cool concepts and options regarding design.

Made a super simple navbar, kindof resembles Discord? Looks cool and easy enough, so I'll keep it here fttb (builds OK and looks fine, fine just fine)

- [useDarkmode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/usehooks-ts): no way I'm gonna reinvent the wheel.
- [Tailwind Dark Mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode): to spice things up a lil.
- [Tailwind Grouping](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#styling-based-on-parent-state): I can't say I knew about this
